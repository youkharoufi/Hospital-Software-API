## Start the app

To start the API server clic on the https button in the toolbar of Visual Studio 2022.


## Description

This is a backend API coded in C# more precisely with the .NET 7.0 framework.
It goes in pair with the "Hospital-Software-UI" also available in my repositories.

## How to use the app

✨ Appointments : As coded in the API, the calendars that I created for each user are updated automatically each week.

You can login as Henry, a patient with these credentials : 
Username : Henry
Password : Password123!

Then clic on the "Doctors" dropdown menu option in the Nav Bar to select which doctor (depending on the medical field) you want to book an appointment with.
To book an appointment click on a doctor, then select a time slot in their calendar by clicking on it. After that you will be redirected to to a page on which 
you will have to clic on a button labelled : "Make an appointment".

✨ Chat : 
In the Nav Bar, you will find a menu option named "Chat", which redirects to a chat that I have created based on the whatsapp application model. You can send
and receive messages from and to doctors.

✨ Doctors profiles : 
As a doctor, you can login as Estelle (credentials are -> Username : Estelle AND Password : Password123!). You can chat with patients and check your calendar 
to see if you have any appointments during the week from 9am to 5pm (UTC+5).

✨ Administrators profiles :
As an administrator, you can login as Youssef (Yes, me haha) and add Doctors and Patients to the software system.
